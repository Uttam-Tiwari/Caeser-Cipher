# Caesar Cipher 🔐

A simple project that implements the **Caesar Cipher** encryption and decryption technique. This classical encryption method shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

## 🔎 What is Caesar Cipher?

The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest and simplest forms of encryption. It works by replacing each letter in the plaintext with a letter a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet.

For example, with a shift of 3:
- A → D
- B → E
- ...
- Z → C

## 🚀 Features

- Encrypt any string using a given shift key
- Decrypt the encrypted text using the same key
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters
- Ignores non-alphabetic characters (e.g., numbers, spaces, punctuation)
- Simple command-line interface (CLI)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Programming Language: **Python** 

##✏️ Example Usage

# Encryption
Input:  HELLO
Shift:  3
Output: KHOOR

# Decryption
Input:  KHOOR
Shift:  3
Output: HELLO
